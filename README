=====================================

What is XenLoop?
================

XenLoop is a transparent inter-VM network loopback
mechanism to communicate between Linux guest VMs
that are co-resident on the same physical machine.
XenLoop uses shared memory to bypass the standard
network data path via netback/netfront and Domain 0
and their associated performance overheads.
There is no need to modify the code in Linux guests
or the hypervisor or the networking applications
in order to use XenLoop.  XenLoop also transparently
adapts to guest migration without disrupting any
ongoing network communication.

This file contains the installation and usage instructions
for XenLoop. More detailed documentation regarding design
and implementation of XenLoop is available in our
technical report at
http://osnet.cs.binghamton.edu/projects/xenloop.html


Where to Get XenLoop?
=====================
The latest release of XenLoop is available at
http://osnet.cs.binghamton.edu/projects/xenloop.html


XenLoop Binary Components
=========================
XenLoop is designed as two kernel modules

- xenloop.ko
	This module is meant to be inserted in each Linux guest
	in which you want to enable the inter-VM loopback
	functionality.

- discovery.ko
	This module is to be inserted in Domain 0, and helps in
	discovering and announcing co-resident Linux guests that
	have an active XenLoop module.

Xenloop does not require any changes to either
the Linux guest code or the Xen hypervisor code.


Compatibility
=============

This distribution contains sources that are known to work with
the following:
- paravirtualized Linux 2.6.18 and 2.6.18.8 guests
- Xen 3.2.

All the Linux guests using XenLoop need have "netfilter"
enabled in kernel.
	http://www.netfilter.org/
This is standard in most linux kernel distributions, but
you may want to check.

We have not yet tested XenLoop with later versions of Xen
and Linux, nor have we tested it with HVMs.
Also, interaction of XenLoop with any firewalls
(such as iptables) has not been tested.
We welcome feedback on any porting related issues.


Building XenLoop
================

To compile XenLoop, simply execute

$ make

in the source directory. This should generate the two
modules, xenloop.ko and discovery.ko.

You will need to compile the modules against your specific
Linux kernel versions of both the Linux guest and Domain 0.


Installing XenLoop
==================

Transfer discovery.ko to Domain 0 and do the following:

$ insmod discovery.ko

In each Linux guest where you wish to run xenloop,
transfer xenloop.ko and do the following:

$ insmod xenloop.ko

The order of above operations does not matter.
What matters is that all modules be installed
for everything to work.

Alternatively, you can set up your system to load
the modules at boot time, depending upon your system
configuration. Only make sure that the modules
are loaded **AFTER** the network interfaces are
brought up. This is because XenLoop uses the
network interface to communicate out-of-band
control messages.


Using XenLoop
=============

Once the modules are installed as described above,
you don't have to do anything special to use xenloop,
other than to run your unmodified networking
applications -- TCP/UDP/ICMP/raw sockets etc.

Currently XenLoop forwards only IP traffic via
inter-VM channel. All other traffic passes
via the standard netfront/netback interface.
This could likely be extended to other protocols
with minor coding effort.

XenLoop modules automatically discover each others'
presence or absence in co-resident guests.
In the former case, they will transparently set up
and use the inter-VM loopback channel. In the latter
case, they will transparently use
the netfront/netback interface.

Any normal network communication between guests and
outside machines remains unaffected.

Running guests can also be migrated without
interrupting applications using XenLoop channels
and without removing the xenloop and discovery
modules. XenLoop modules automatically discover
when a co-resident guest migrates away, or a remote
guest becomes co-resident; correspondingly they
tear down or set up inter-VM loopback channels.


Testing XenLoop
===============

To test whether your installed XenLoop is working,
ping between co-resident guests without the modules and
note the RTT. Then insert the modules
and ping again. The RTT with XenLoop
should be about many times smaller than without
XenLoop. We observed a factor of 5 to 6 improvement
in RTT on our dual-core machines.

You can also test XenLoop throughput performance on
your system using standard unmodified benchmarks such
as netperf, lmbench, netpipe-mpich etc.


Some Adjustable Parameters in The Code
======================================

MAX_MAC_NUM:
	If you want to install Xenloop on more than 10
	guests in one physical machine, you can
	adjust the "MAX_MAC_NUM" parameter accordingly
	in discovery.h and main.h.

XENLOOP_ENTRY_ORDER:
	(This parameter is rendered less useful with
	 XenLoop release 2.0 onwards)
	"XENLOOP_ENTRY_ORDER" in xenloop.h determines
	the number of FIFO entries in each direction.

	Number of entries = 2 ^ XENLOOP_ENTRY_ORDER

MAX_FIFO_PAGES
	"MAX_FIFO_PAGES" in xenfifo.h  defines the maximum
	number of shared memory pages you could can use for
	each FIFO. Again this can be changed, but you may
	hit a hypervisor-imposed limit at some point.

Feel free to browse the code for other parameters you
may want to tweak, such as periodic discovery
announcement interval from Domain 0, timeout intervals
for control message replies etc.

Some Other Useful Components of XenLoop
========================================
There are a few components in XenLoop that may be
useful in their own right.

- xenfifo.c and xenfifo.h provide a unidirectional
  FIFO functionality using inter-domain shared memory.
  They implement a lockless producer-consumer interaction,
  assuming that one guest is the producer and another
  is consumer. There is nothing to enforce these roles
  though and both guests can act as both producers
  and consumers. If there can be multiple producer
  or consumer threads in a guest, you may want to use
  your own producer-local and consumer-local locks, like
  we do in XenLoop. The FIFO manipulation primitives,
  we hope, are self-contained enough to be used in
  other context with little or no modification.

- The discovery module could also be used, with
  minor modifications, in other contexts where one
  wishes to transparently discover other co-resident
  domains.
